    <h2>The CPU(Central Processing Unit)</h2>

    <p>
      The CPU is arguably the most important part of the computer, with it's
      importance tying only with the motherboard. The CPU is responsible for
      most calculations, its effectivly the computer's brain. The better your
      CPU, the faster the computer can calculate whatever you desire, be it 1+1,
      or complex light and water physics, the CPU can do it. (This statement is
      not entirely true, different CPUS can very in performance and cost, with
      some costing around $1000 in exchange for incredible performance).
      Compared to a human, it is the <strong>Parital Lobes</strong> of the
      computer.

    <h2>The Motherboard</h2>

    <p>
      The Motherboard is the backbone that ties the computer's components
      together at one spot and allows the to communicate with each other.
      Without the motherboard, none of the computer parts (CPU, GPU, RAM, Hard
      drive) could interact. Without a working motherboard, a computer with eve
      the best parts is useless. It works by connecting all of the hardware to
      your processor, and it distributes the electricity to all of the hardware.
      Compared to a human, it is the <strong>Nervous System</strong> of the
      computer.

    <h2>The GPU(Graphics Processing Unit)</h2>

    <p>
      The Graphics Card/ Video card is a specialized processor designed to
      accelerate graphics rendering. They are able to process many pieces of
      data at the same time, making them incredibly useful for machine learning,
      video editing, and most kinds of offline/online gaming. Some graphics
      cards with the RTX pretext have special hardware and software that allows
      it to simulate rays, with light rays being what most people use it for.
      Compared to a human, it is the <strong>Optical Nerve</strong> of the
      computer.

    <h2>The SSD (Hard Disk Drive)/ SSD (Solid State Drive)</h2>

    <img src="img/SSD vs HDD.jpg" alt="SSD vs HDD" width="500px" />

    <p>
      The SSD and HDD are what stores and retrieves digital data in a computer.
      The main differences between the two are that SSDs are faster,
      non-mechanical, shock resistant, last-longer, are better for gaming, are
      more effeicient, and are more reliable. HDDs are cheaper, and are better
      suited for stroing extra data, like movies, photos and documents. All in
      all, SSDs are better,
