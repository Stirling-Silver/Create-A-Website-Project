    <h2>The CPU(Central Processing Unit)</h2>

    <p>
      The CPU is arguably the most important part of the computer, with it's
      importance tying only with the motherboard. The CPU is responsible for
      most calculations, its effectivly the computer's brain. The better your
      CPU, the faster the computer can calculate whatever you desire, be it 1+1,
      or complex light and water physics, the CPU can do it. (This statement is
      not entirely true, different CPUS can very in performance and cost, with
      some costing around $1000 in exchange for incredible performance).
      Compared to a human, it is the brain of the computer.

    <h2>The Motherboard</h2>

    <p>
      The Motherboard is the backbone that ties the computer's components
      together at one spot and allows the to communicate with each other.
      Without the motherboard, none of the computer parts (CPU, GPU, RAM, Hard
      drive) could interact. Without a working motherboard, a computer with eve
      the best parts is useless. It works by connecting all of the hardware to
      your processor, and it distributes the electricity to all of the hardware.
      Compared to a human, it is the Skeleton of the computer.
