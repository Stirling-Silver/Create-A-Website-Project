    <h2>The CPU(Central Processing Unit)</h2>

    <img src="img/CPU.Jpeg" alt="CPU" width="500" />

    <p>
        The CPU is arguably the most important part of the computer, with it's
      importance tying only with the motherboard. The CPU is responsible for
      most calculations, its effectively the computer's brain. The better your
      CPU, the faster the computer can calculate whatever you desire, be it 1+1,
      or complex light and water physics, the CPU can do it. (This statement is
      not entirely true, different CPUS can vary in performance and cost, with
      some costing around $1000 in exchange for incredible performance).
      Compared to a human, it is the <strong>Parital Lobes</strong> of the
      computer.

    <h2>The Motherboard</h2>

    <p>
        The Motherboard is the backbone that ties the computer's components
      together at one spot and allows the to communicate with each other.
      Without the motherboard, none of the computer parts (CPU, GPU, RAM, Hard
      drive) could interact. Without a working motherboard, a computer with eve
      the best parts is useless. It works by connecting all of the hardware to
      your processor, and it distributes the electricity to all of the hardware.
      Compared to a human, it is the <strong>Nervous System</strong> of the
      computer.

    <h2>The GPU(Graphics Processing Unit)</h2>

    <p>
        The Graphics Card/ Video card is a specialized processor designed to
      accelerate graphics rendering. They are able to process many pieces of
      data at the same time, making them incredibly useful for machine learning,
      video editing, and most kinds of offline/online gaming. Some graphics
      cards with the RTX pretext have special hardware and software that allows
      it to simulate rays, with light rays being what most people use it for.
      Compared to a human, it is the <strong>Optical Nerve</strong> of the
      computer.

    <h2>The SSD (Hard Disk Drive)/ SSD (Solid State Drive)</h2>

    <img src="img/SSD vs HDD.jpg" alt="SSD vs HDD" width="500px" />

    <p>
        The SSD and HDD are what stores and retrieves digital data in a computer.
      The main differences between the two are that SSDs are faster,
      non-mechanical, shock resistant, last-longer, are better for gaming, are
      more effeicient, and are more reliable. HDDs are cheaper, and are better
      suited for stroing extra data, like movies, photos and documents. All in
      all, SSDs are better for performance, but it doesn't really matter if you
      just use your computer casually. Compared to a human, they are the
      <strong>Hippocampus</strong> of the computer.

    <h2>The RAM(Random Access Memory)</h2>

    <img src="img/Ram.jpg" alt="Ram" width="500px" />

    <p>
        RAM is the hardware in a computer where the operating system, application
      programs and data in current use are kept so they can be quickly reached
      by the device's processor. There are different types of RAM, those being
      SRAM(Static Random Access Memory), DRAM(Dynamic Access Memory), and
      ECC(Error-Correcting Code). SRAM and DRAM are two classifacations of
      memory, with ECC just being a type of DRAM that has an additional cell to
      detect and correct random faults. With SRAM, data is stored using a six
      transistor memory cell. DRAM store data using a transister and capacitor
      pair, which makes up one DRAM cell, is is cheaper that SRAM, but it is
      also slightly slower than SRAM. Compared to a human, they are the
      <strong>Pre-Frontal Lobe</strong> of the computer.

    <h2>The PSU(Power Supply Unit)</h2>

    <img src="img/Power Supply.jpg" alt="Power Supply" width="500px" />

    <p> 
      The PSU converts alternating high voltage current(AC) into direct curr(DC), they also regulate the DC output voltage to be what the computer can handle. You could also use a UPS(Uninterruptible Power Supply), it is essentually a power supply that saves some electricity for when the power fails, it will then start supplying the computer with said backup electricity for a few minutes, the transition is near instantaneous. The electricity is stored within batteries, supercapacitors, or flywheels. Compared to a human, it is the <strong>Heart</strong> of the computer.
